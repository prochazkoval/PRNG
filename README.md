# Pseudorandom number Generator
This Pseudorandom number Generator is part of my **Bachelor's Thesis at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication at Brno University of Technology (VUT)**.

This PRNG application is using **cursor movement** to generate pseudorandom bites. You can choose the speed (bites per seconds) and number of generated bites.

After generating all required bits application will alert user by a beep sound. Generated bites can be saved to .txt file. From generated bites is also safe password generated.

This application was created using Java and can be extended by adding other ways for generating numbers.
